This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: using an uninitialized pointer. The `bug.c` file contains code that attempts to dereference an uninitialized pointer, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes. The `bugSolution.c` file shows the corrected version, which initializes the pointer before use.
